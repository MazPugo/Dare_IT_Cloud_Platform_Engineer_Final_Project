Choice


I have chosen the way to build the web application with Google App Engine.

I think that this is the most accessible way to create the web aplication. I have used at my work an html page that I have created 
for my Kodilla Bootcam in Data Science

I have tried to deploy kubernates and I have managed the create the cluster but I had some difficulties to finish the task.
